# RGPopup.Maui

Popup controls for .NET MAUI migrated from Rg.Plugins.Popup for Xamarin with some fixes.


## Setup
* Available on NuGet: [RGPopup.Maui](http://www.nuget.org/packages/RGPopup.Maui) [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RGPopup.Maui.svg?label=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RGPopup.Maui)
* Add nuget package to your project.
* Add ```.UseMauiRGPopup()``` to your MauiApp builder.

```csharp
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseMauiRGPopup(config =>
            {
                config.BackPressHandler = null;
                config.FixKeyboardOverlap = true;
            })
            .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
            {
                fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
                fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
            });

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```


## Support platforms

- [x] Android      (Migrated from Rg.Plugins.Popup)
- [x] iOS          (Migrated from Rg.Plugins.Popup)
- [x] MacCatalyst  (Migrated from Rg.Plugins.Popup)
- [x] Windows      (Migrated from Mopups)


## Known Issues

1.[Windows] If you need add .UseMauiCompatibility() to your app builder, then you'd better not add ContentView to the PopupPage, otherwise the subview of ContentView will not show correctly (It may be .NET MAUI's bug).
